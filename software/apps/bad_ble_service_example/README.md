BLE Service Example
===================

Sends BLE advertisements from Buckler and allows connections. On connection,
services are included with characteristics that allow for reading and writing
values from the devices.

Connections can be made by any BLE devices. The simplest way to test it out is
to use your smartphone. We recommend the "nRF Connect" app on Android and iOS.
Find the device and select the "Connect" button.
